Simulating the Monty Hall problem, just for fun

I read about the monty hall problem. See here for more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lb-6rxZxx0. It just seems so unintuative that switching your choice is twice and good as sticking with the original. The stats reason behind it makes sense but it just doesn't 'feel' right. Had to simulate it to see.
